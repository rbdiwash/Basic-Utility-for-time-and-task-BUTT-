In September 1997 the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) adopted a Universal Declaration on
 Democracy. That Declaration affirms the principles of democracy, the elements and exercise
 of democratic government, and the international scope of democracy.The international confe
rences on new and restored democracies[3] (ICNRD process) began in 1988 under the initiati
ve of President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines after the so-called peaceful "People 
Power Revolution" overthrew the 20-year dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Initially an int
er-governmental forum, the ICNRD process developed into a tripartite structure with partic
ipation of governments, parliaments and civil society. The sixth conference (ICNRD-6) that
 took place in Doha, Qatar, in 2006 reinforced the tripartite nature of the process and co
ncluded with a declaration and Plan of Action which reaffirmed the fundamental principles 
and values of democracy.
