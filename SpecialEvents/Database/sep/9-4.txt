The origins of Teacher Day are murky. Around 1944, a Wisconsin teacher named Ryan Krug 
began corresponding with political and education leaders about the need for a national 
day to honor teachers. Woodbridge wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt, who in 1953 persuaded the 
81st Congress to proclaim a National Teacher Day. NEA along with its Kansas and Indiana 
state affiliates and the Dodge City, Kansas local NEA branch lobbied Congress to create
 a national day celebrating teachers. Congress declared 7 March 1980 as National Teacher
 Day for that year only. The NEA and its affiliates continued to observe Teacher Day on
 the first Tuesday in March until 1985, when the National PTA established Teacher Apprec
iation Week in the first full week of May. The NEA Representative Assembly then voted to
 make the Tuesday of that week National Teacher Day. As of 4 November 1976, 6 November
 was adopted as Teachers' Day in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. Currently, Massachuset
ts sets the first Sunday of June as its own Teachers' Day annually.
