World Cancer Day is an international day marked on February 4 to raise awareness
 of cancer and to encourage its prevention, detection, and treatment. World Canc
er Day was founded by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) to suppo
rt the goals of the World Cancer Declaration, written in 2008. The primary goal 
of the World Cancer Day is to significantly reduce illness and death caused by 
cancer by 2020World Cancer Day targets misinformation,[2] raises awareness, and
 reduces stigma.
 Multiple initiatives run on World Cancer Day to show support for those affected
 by cancer. One of these movements is #NoHairSelfie, a global movement to have "
hairticipants" shave their heads either physically or virtually to show a symbol 
of courage for those undergoing cancer treatment.[4] Images of participants are 
then shared over social media. Local events also take place
