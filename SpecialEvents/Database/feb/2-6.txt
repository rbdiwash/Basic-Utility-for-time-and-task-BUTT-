One of the beliefs in support for this day acknowledges that culture is in
 “constant flux,” and with the concerns begetting FGM being so high-risk, 
the abolition of such practices must be prompt. This is a movement for the
 rights of women and their bodies, as well as the protection of their phys
ical health- which can be tremendously affected later in life. These effor
ts are to benefit actions fighting violence against women and girls as a w
hole. Every Woman, Every Child (a global movement), reports that “Although
 primarily concentrated in 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East, FGM
 is a universal problem and is also practiced in some countries in Asia an
d Latin America. FGM continues to persist amongst immigrant populations li
ving in Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.” In the 
United States alone, the recent reports of how many women and young girls 
are affected by FGM staggeringly tripled in numbers in comparison to the p
revious reports in 1990. About 120 to 140 million women have been subject t
o FGM over the years and currently at least 3 million girls are at risk eac
h year, in accord to data presented by the World Health Organization (WHO).
 It is an effort to make the world aware of FGM and to promote its eradicat
ion.[2] The World Health Organization has said that "Though the practice has
 persisted for over a thousand years, programmatic evidence suggests that 
FGM/C can end in one generation."[3]
