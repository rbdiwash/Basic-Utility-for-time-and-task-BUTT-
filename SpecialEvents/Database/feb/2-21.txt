It was a social movement built on the spirit to defend the rights to write in 
one's mother language.
International Mother Language Day has been being observed since 2000[4] to 
promote peace and multilingualism. The date corresponds to the day in 1952 
when students from the University of Dhaka, Jagannath College and Dhaka Medi
cal College, demonstrating for the recognition of Bengali as one of the two 
national languages of East Pakistan, were brutally shot dead by police (the
n under Pakistan government) near the Dhaka High Court in the capital of
 present-day Bangladesh."Mother language" is the calque of a term used in
 several Romance languages — lengua materna (Spanish), lingua madre (Italian)
 and langue maternelle (French) "mamiaith" (Welsh) — as well as the Estonian
 "emakeel", the Sanskrit. The more literal and more common English translation
 is "mother tongue", while "native language" has the same meaning and is also
 in common use. In linguistics, the English term "mother language" usually 
refers to an ancestral language, often a proto-language, relative to its
 descendent language family.
