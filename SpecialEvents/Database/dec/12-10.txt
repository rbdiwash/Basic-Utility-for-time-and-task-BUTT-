The date was chosen to honour the United Nations General Assembly's adoption and
 proclamation, on 10 December 1948, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 (UDHR), the first global enunciation of human rights and one of the first major
 achievements of the new United Nations. The formal establishment of Human Rights
 Day occurred at the 317th Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on 4 December 
1950, when the General Assembly declared resolution 423(V), inviting all member s
tates and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.

The day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings 
and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. In addit
ion it is traditionally on 10 December that the five-yearly United Nations Prize 
in the Field of Human Rights and Nobel Peace Prize are awarded. Many governmental
 and non-governmental organizations active in the human rights field also schedul
e special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organiz
ations.
