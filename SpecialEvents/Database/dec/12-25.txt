Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observ
ed most commonly on December 25[4][9][10] as a religious and cultural celebrati
on among billions of people around the world.[2][11][12] A feast central to the
 Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the N
ativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in t
he West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night;[13] in some traditio
ns, Christmastide includes an Octave.[14] The traditional Christmas narrative, 
the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born
 in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies;[15] when Joseph and Mar
y arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable wh
ere the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shephe
rds who then disseminated the message furthermore.[16] Christmas Day is a publi
c holiday in many of the world's nations,[17][18][19] is celebrated religiously
 by the vast majority of Christians,[20] as well as culturally by a number of n
on-Christian people,[1][21] and is an integral part of the holiday season, whil
e some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrati
ng Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, wit
h gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.
