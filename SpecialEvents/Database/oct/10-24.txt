The General Assembly in 1972 instituted World Development Information Day to draw the attention
 of world public opinion to development problems and the need to strengthen international coope
ration to solve them (resolution 3038 (XXVII)).  The Assembly decided that the date for the Day
 should coincide in principle with United Nations Day, 24 October, which was also the date of 
the adoption, in 1970, of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations 
Development Decade.The Assembly felt that improving the dissemination of information and the
 mobilization of public opinion, particularly among young people, would lead to greater awarene
ss of the problems of development, thus, promoting efforts in the sphere of international coope
ration for development.
