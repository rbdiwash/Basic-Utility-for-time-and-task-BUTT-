The International Day of Non-Violence is observed on October 2, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.
 This day is referred to in India as Gandhi Jayanti.In January 2004, Iranian Nobel laureate Sh
irin Ebadi had taken a proposal for an International Day of Non-Violence from a Hindi teacher 
in Paris teaching international students to the World Social Forum in Mumbai. The idea gradual
ly attracted the interest of some leaders of India's Congress Party ("Ahimsa Finds Teen Voice",
 The Telegraph, Calcutta) until a Satyagraha Conference resolution in New Delhi in January 2007
, initiated by Indian National Congress President and Chairperson of the United Progressive All
iance Sonia Gandhi and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called upon the United Nations to adopt the idea.
