The inaugural International Hepatitis C Awareness day, coordinated by various E
uropean and Middle Eastern Patient Groups and Baby Muriel, took place on Octobe
r 1, 2004,[3] However many patient groups continued to mark 'hepatitis day' on 
disparate dates.[4] For this reason in 2008, the World Hepatitis Alliance in co
llaboration with patient groups declared May 19 the first global World Hepatiti
s Day.

Following the adoption of a resolution during the 63rd World Health Assembly in 
May 2010, World Hepatitis Day was given global endorsement as the primary focus 
for national and international awareness-raising efforts and the date was change
d to July 28 (in honour of Nobel Laureate Baruch Samuel Blumberg, discoverer of 
the hepatitis B virus, who celebrates his birthday on that date). The resolutio
n resolves that "28 July shall be designated as World Hepatitis Day in order to
provide an opportunity for education and greater understanding of viral hepatitis 
as a global public health problem, and to stimulate the strengthening of preventi
ve and control measures of this disease in Member States."
