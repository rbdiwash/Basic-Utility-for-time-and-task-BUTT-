Friendship Day (Arabic: Çáíæã ÇáÏæáí ááÕÏÇÞÉýý, Chinese: French: Journée inter
nationale de l’amitié, Russian:, Spanish: D?a del Amig
o) is a day for celebrating friendship. The day has been celebrated in several s
outhern South American countries for many years, particularly in Paraguay, where
 the first World Friendship Day - International Friendship Day was proposed in 1
958.

Initially created by the greeting card industry, evidence from social networking 
sites shows a revival of interest in the holiday that may have grown with the spr
ead of the Internet, particularly in India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia. Digital com
munication modes such as the Internet and mobile phones may be helping to popular
ize the custom, since greeting friends en masse is now easier than before.

Those who promote the holiday in South Asia attribute the tradition of dedicating 
a day in honor of friends to have originated in the U.S. in 1935, but it actually 
dates from 1919. The exchange of Friendship Day gifts like flowers, cards and wris
t bands is a popular tradition of this occasion.[1][2]

Friendship Day celebrations occur on different dates in different countries. The f
irst World Friendship Day was proposed for 30 July in 1958, by the World Friendship
 Crusade.[3] On 27 April 2011 the General Assembly of the United Nations declared[4
] 30 July as official International Friendship Day. However, some countries, includ

ing India[5], celebrate Friendship Day on the first Sunday of August. In Oberlin, Oh
io, Friendship Day is celebrated on 8 April each year.
