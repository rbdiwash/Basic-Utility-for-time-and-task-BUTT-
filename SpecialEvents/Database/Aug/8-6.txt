			Sisters Day
Whether it is in the closest of bonds or the farthest of distance between us, our family is some
 of the closest ties many of us have outside of marriage and children. This day is to celebrate
 one of those very bonds, one that has sparked many stories, movies and songs.

History of Sister’s Day 
The history of sisters is something to view back as far as time goes back. A sister was one that
 you confided in, asked question to the older ones, guided the younger ones, and were there to h
elp them either way during the bad times, and celebrate with them on the good times. A sister ma
y not be the ones born of the same mother or father, but those close enough that they might as w
ell share your blood.

How to celebrate Sister’s Day
A sister is one that you are close to, so telling you how to celebrate Sister’s Day is like tell
ing you how you like your dinner prepared – best to make that decision yourself after some loose
ly given suggestions if you are totally in the dark. Make the time to reconnect, and remember 
that while we are all here, it is the bonds with one another that we share that really makes the 
life blossom from existence into a beautiful cornucopia of craziness we all call life. Best to
 cherish each bond, each moment we have with those of us we are closest to.
