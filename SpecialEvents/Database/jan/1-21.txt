Origin of National Hugging Day:

National Hugging Day was created in 1986 by Rev. Kevin Zaborney from Caro, 
Michigan. Strangely, this day is copyrighted. One would think that hugs should
 be given freely and without recourse. Regardless, we are thankful to the Rever
end Zaborney for creating this day and would love to thank him with a  great, 
big hug.

We found no reference to this day as a "National" day, which requires an act of
 congress.
