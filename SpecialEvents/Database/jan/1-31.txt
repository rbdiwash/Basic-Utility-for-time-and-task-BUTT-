Date When Celebrated : Always January 31

Backward Day is a day to do everything backwards. Use your imagination, and
 Backward Day can be lots of fun. It's especially popular with school aged kids.


Try writing backwards or reading backwards. Wear your shirt with the back in the
 front. Eat your meal, starting with dessert. Now that's what I call fun! Walk 
backwards, or talk backwards. Play a board game backwards, from the finish line
 to the start. Are you starting to get the picture!?

This day is limited only by your imagination.
