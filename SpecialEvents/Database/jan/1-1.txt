New Year's Eve is when all the fun and festivities are. We see out the old year
 and ring in the new. While it is often thought of as a time to drink and be me
rry, many people take it as an opportunity to eat and be merry. Drinking is not
 as much a part of the event as it was decades ago, if only because of tougher 

drunk driving laws.
New Years' Day on the other hand, is a time to relax and enjoy the start of a b
right and promising new year....a new beginning. It is a time to be with family
. After all, you haven't seen your mother in law since last year.

So, enjoy everything about New Year's....it only comes once a year.

To many Americans, the ball dropping at Times Square in New York City signals t
he start of the new year in this country. The ball was first dropped in 1908.
