International Museum Day (IMD) is an international day a celebration that held 
every year on or around 18 May, coordinated by the International Council of 
Museums (ICOM). The event highlights a specific theme that changes every year
 and that is at the heart of the international museum community’s preoccupations.

The IMD provides the opportunity for museum professionals to meet the public 
and alert them as to the challenges that museums face. Indeed, following the 
definition of museums provided by ICOM, a museum is a non-profit, permanent 
institution in the service of society and its development, open to the publi
c, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tang
ible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purpose
s of education, study and enjoyment. International Museum Day therefore serv
es as a platform to raise public awareness on the role museums play in the d
evelopment of society today, on an international level.
