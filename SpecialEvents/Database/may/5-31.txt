World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) is observed around the world every year on May 31. 
It is intended to encourage a 24-hour period of abstinence from all forms of t
obacco consumption around the globe. The day is further intended to draw atten

s, which currently lead to nearly 6 million deaths each year worldwide, includ
ing 600,000 of which are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-han
d smoke.[1] The member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) created W
orld No Tobacco Day in 1987. In the past twenty nine years, the day has been m
et with both enthusiasm and resistance around the globe from governments, publ
ic health organizations, smokers, growers, and the tobacco industry
