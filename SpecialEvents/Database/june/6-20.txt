On 4 December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 55/76 dec
ided that, from 2001, 20 June would be celebrated as World Refugee Day. In this
 resolution, the General Assembly noted that 2001 marked the 50th anniversary 
of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.[1]

African Refugee Day had been formally celebrated in several countries prior to 
2000. The UN noted that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had agreed to 
have International Refugee Day coincide with Africa Refugee Day on 20 June.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the World Day of Migrants and Refugees is celebr
ated in January each year, having been instituted in 1914 by Pope Pius X.
