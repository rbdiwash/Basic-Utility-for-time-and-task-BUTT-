Zero Discrimination Day is an annual day celebrated by the UN and other
 international organisations. The day aims to promote equality before 
the law and in practice throughout all of the member countries of the
UN. The day was first celebrated on March 1, 2014, and was launched by
UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé on 27 February of that year wi
th a major event in Beijing.[1]
In February 2017, UNAIDS called on people to 'make some noise around 
zero discrimination, to speak up and prevent discrimination from sta
nding in the way of achieving ambitions, goals and dreams.
The day is particularly noted by organisations like UNAIDS that combat
discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. “HIV related stigma
and discrimination is pervasive and exists in almost every part of the 
world including our Liberia", according to Dr. Ivan F. Camanor, Chairman
of the National AIDS Commission of Liberia.[3] The UNDP also paid tribute
in 2017 to LGBTI people with HIV/AIDS who face discrimination.[4]
