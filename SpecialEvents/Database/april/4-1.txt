April Fools' Day (sometimes called All Fools' Day) is celebrated every year on
 April 1 by playing practical jokes and spreading hoaxes. The jokes and their 
victims are called April fools. People playing April Fool jokes expose their
 prank by shouting April Fool. Some newspapers, magazines, and other published
 media report fake stories, which are usually explained the next day or below 
the news section in small letters. Although popular since the 19th century, th
e day is not a public holiday in any country.Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbur
y Tales (1392) contains the first recorded association between April 1 and foo
lishness.
